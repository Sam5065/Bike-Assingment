Programming bike assingment

"Using the C# programming language you are required to create a bicycle sales/rental system for a small business. You have been provided with a basic Bike class file and a text file containing the initial bikes that your company will have in stock. You must use these files as the starting point of your assignment. You are able to extend the Bike class but you must not remove any of the code that is currently within it. You may make changes to the Program class as you wish. 

Your program should have a fully working menu allowing the user to perform the following tasks:

•	Add bikes to the inventory
•	Remove bikes from the inventory
•	Edit bikes within the inventory
•	Show the number of bikes in the inventory
•	Allow bikes to be hired, sold and bought
•	Produce a report showing all the bikes currently in the inventory and their status. This should be written to a text file."
